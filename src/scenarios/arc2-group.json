      "storyContext": "Your team has spent two weeks turning mountains of GPS tracks, supply logs, radio transcripts, and decision timestamps into a report for the Chief of Army. The analysis is done. You're sitting in the briefing room at SAFTI Military Institute. The Chief picks up your executive summary, reads it, then puts it down. \"During the exercise, my commanders were making decisions on positions that were twenty minutes old. Before that, the whole screen crashed when 500 people logged in. Before that, we couldn't get a signal in half the training area.\" He looks at each of you. \"Was this a technology problem, a design problem, or a people problem?\"",
      "facilitatorPrompt": "He's looking at all of us. Let's get this right. What actually caused the stale data during the live exercise? Was it the jungle network dropping packets? Was it the system not built to handle degradation? Or was it that commanders were never trained to question what the screen was showing them?",

If we train every officer to cross-reference digital intelligence with radio reports and their own observation, the stale data becomes one input, not the only one.",

We've written a phased plan: strengthen the network this quarter, redesign the system over the next year, update training for the following cycle. But it takes three years and significant budget.",

We're building a new generation of soldiers who will fight in a world where the battlefield is as much digital as physical. I can fast-track one capability into the SAF's training roadmap for the next five years. Every recruit and officer who comes through will be shaped by what you recommend. What should it be?\"",
      "facilitatorPrompt": "This shapes the next generation of the SAF. Everyone think carefully. What was the hardest thing we faced during Northstar? Not just the technical problems. What capability, if our people had it, would have changed the outcome? What does Singapore actually need?",
