The Chief of Army wants a data-driven report on unit readiness, decision speed, and logistics efficiency within two weeks. The findings will shape how the SAF trains for the next five years. Your team has mountains of GPS tracks, supply logs, radio transcripts, and decision timestamps. Time to turn raw data into answers that matter.",
