Three screens show cascading failures across the nation: traffic lights going dark, hospital backup generators kicking in, MRT signalling systems throwing errors. Your CO's face is grim: 'This isn't a glitch. Someone attacked us. They hit the power grid first to blind us, then went after hospitals and transport while we were scrambling. This is the real deal, operators. Every decision you make in the next 2 hours matters. The leaderboard doesn't just track your score now, it tracks who steps up when the nation needs them.'",
